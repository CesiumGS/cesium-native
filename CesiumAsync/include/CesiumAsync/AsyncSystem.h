 * @brief A system for managing asynchronous requests and tasks.
 *
 * Instances of this class may be safely and efficiently stored and passed
 * around by value. However, it is essential that the _last_ AsyncSystem
 * instance be destroyed only after all continuations have run to completion.
 * Otherwise, continuations may be scheduled using invalid scheduler instances,
 * leading to a crash. Broadly, there are two ways to achieve this:
 *
 *   * Wait until all Futures complete before destroying the "owner" of the
 *     AsyncSystem.
 *   * Make the AsyncSystem a global or static local in order to extend its
 *     lifetime all the way until program termination.
