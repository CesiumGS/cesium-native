# Change Log

### v0.3.0 - 2021-05-03

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Converted `magic_enum` / `CodeCoverage.cmake` dependencies to external submodules.
- Replaced `CesiumGltf::WriteFlags` bitmask with `CesiumGltf::WriteModelOptions` struct.
  `CesiumGltf::writeModelAsEmbeddedBytes` and `CesiumGltf::writeModelAndExternalfiles`
  now use this struct for configuration.
- Removed all exceptions in `WriterException.h`, warnings / errors are now reported in
 `WriteModelResult`, which is returned from `CesiumGltf::writeModelAsEmbeddedBytes` and
 `CesiumGltf::writeModelAndExternalFiles` instead.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for loading the water mask from quantized-mesh terrain tiles.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Let a tile be renderable if all its raster overlays are ready, even if some are still loading.

### v0.2.0 - 2021-04-19

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Moved `JsonValue` from the `CesiumGltf` library to the `CesiumUtility` library and changes some of its methods.
- Renamed `CesiumGltf::Reader` to `CesiumGltf::GltfReader`.
- Made the `readModel` and `readImage` methods on `GltfReader` instance methods instead of static methods.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added `CesiumGltfWriter` library.
- Added `CesiumJsonReader` library.
- Added diagnostic details to error messages for invalid glTF inputs.
- Added diagnostic details to error messages for failed OAuth2 authorization with `CesiumIonClient::Connection`.
- Added an `Axis` enum and `AxisTransforms` class for coordinate system transforms
- Added support for the legacy `gltfUpVector` string property in the `asset` part of tilesets. The up vector is read and passed as an `Axis` in the `extras["gltfUpVector"]` property, so that receivers may rotate the glTF model's up-vector to match the Z-up convention of 3D Tiles.
- Unknown glTF extensions are now deserialized as a `JsonValue`. Previously, they were ignored.
- Added the ability to register glTF extensions for deserialization using `GltReader::registerExtension`.
- Added `GltfReader::setExtensionState`, which can be used to request that an extension not be deserialized or that it be deserialized as a `JsonValue` even though a statically-typed class is available for the extension.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Gave glTFs created from quantized-mesh terrain tiles a more sensible material with a `metallicFactor` of 0.0 and a `roughnessFactor` of 1.0. Previously the default glTF material was used, which has a `metallicFactor` of 1.0, leading to an undesirable appearance.
- Reported zero-length images as non-errors as `BingMapsRasterOverlay` purposely requests that the Bing servers return a zero-length image for non-existent tiles.
- 3D Tiles geometric error is now scaled by the tile's transform.
- Fixed a bug that that caused a 3D Tiles tile to fail to refine when any of its children had an unsupported type of content.

### v0.1.0 - 2021-03-30

- Initial release.
