 * used to identify and access the children of a given tile.
 *
 * Depending on the exact type of the tile and its contents, this
 * identifier may have different forms:
 *
 * * A `std::string`: This is an explicitly-described tile and
 *   the ID is the URL of the tile's content.
 * * A {@link CesiumGeometry::QuadtreeTileID}: This is an implicit
 *   tile in the quadtree. The URL of the tile's content is formed
 *   by instantiating the context's template URL with this ID.
 * * A {@link CesiumGeometry::OctreeTileID}: This is an implicit
 *   tile in the octree. The URL of the tile's content is formed
 *   by instantiating the context's template URL with this ID.
 * * A {@link CesiumGeometry::UpsampledQuadtreeNode}: This tile doesn't
 *   have any content, but content for it can be created by subdividing
 *   the parent tile's content.
