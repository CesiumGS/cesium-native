 *    to its children.
 * 2. Treat it as an indication that nothing need be rendered in this
 *    area at this level-of-detail. In other words, "render" it as a
 *    hole. To have this behavior, the tile should _not_ have content at
 *    all.
 *
 * We distinguish whether the tileset creator wanted (1) or (2) by
 * comparing this tile's geometricError to the geometricError of its
 * parent tile. If this tile's error is greater than or equal to its
 * parent, treat it as (1). If it's less, treat it as (2).
