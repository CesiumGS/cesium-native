## üìñAbout

Cesium Native is a set of C++ libraries for 3D geospatial, including:

* [3D Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles) runtime streaming
* lightweight glTF serialization and deserialization
* high-precision 3D geospatial math types and functions, including support for global-scale WGS84 ellipsoids.
* support for draping raster overlays from WMS, TMS, WMTS, and other sources over 3D tilesets

Cesium Native powers Cesium's runtime integrations for [Cesium for Unreal](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal), [Cesium for Unity](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unity), [Cesium for Omniverse](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-omniverse), and [Cesium for O3DE](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-o3de). Cesium Native is the foundational layer for any 3D geospatial software, especially those that want to stream 3D Tiles. See [Projects Using Cesium Native](#projects-using-cesium-native) for a list of projects currently integrating with Cesium Native.

## üîßProjects Using Cesium Native

The following official Cesium integrations are built on top of Cesium Native:

- [Cesium for Unreal](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal)
- [Cesium for Unity](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unity)

In addition, Cesium Native has been used by the community to build projects including:
- [vsgCs](https://github.com/timoore/vsgCs) integrates Cesium Native with VulkanSceneGraph.
- [osgEarth](https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth) uses Cesium Native to load 3D Tiles in OpenSceneGraph.

If you have a project that integrates with Cesium Native that isn't on this list yet, please let us know!

## ‚åõ Backward Compatibility

Cesium Native currently does not have any measures for deprecation or backwards compatibility. This grants us the mobility needed for rapid, iterative development.

Breaking changes can be made without warning, but they should be well-documented under the `Breaking Changes` section in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).

> [!note]
> This will change when Cesium Native is officially released as v1.0.0 with a stabilized API.
