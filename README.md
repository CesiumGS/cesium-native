# Cesium Native

Cesium Native is a set of C++ libraries for 3D geospatial, including:

* [3D Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles) runtime streaming
* lightweight glTF serialization and deserialization, and
* high-precision 3D geospatial math types and functions, including support for global-scale WGS84 ellipsoids.

Currently Cesium Native is used to develop [Cesium for Unreal](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal). In the future, we plan for Cesium Native to be a foundational layer for any 3D geospatial software, especially those that want to stream 3D Tiles.

## üíªDevelopers

### ‚≠êPrerequisites

* Visual Studio 2017 (or newer), GCC v7.x+, Clang 10+. Other compilers may work but haven't been tested.
* CMake

### :rocket:Getting Started

#### Clone the repo

Check out the repo with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CesiumGS/cesium-native.git --recurse-submodules
```

If you forget the `--recurse-submodules`, nothing will work because the git submodules will be missing. You should be able to fix it with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Compile

You can then build cesium-native on the command-line with CMake:

```bash
## Windows compilation using Visual Studio
cmake -B build -S . -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
cmake --build build --config Debug
cmake --build build --config Release

## Linux compilation
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

Or, you can easily build it in Visual Studio Code with the `CMake Tools` extension installed. It should prompt you to generate project files from CMake. On Windows, choose `Visual Studio 2017 Release - amd64` as the kit to build. Or choose an appropriate kit for your platform. Then press Ctrl-Shift-P and execute the `CMake: Build` task or press F7.

#### Generate Documentation

* Install [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).
* Run: `cmake --build build --target cesium-native-docs`
* Open `build/doc/html/index.html`
